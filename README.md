👋 Hi, I’m @gabzaf, Gabriel Affonso.

🌱 Currently immersed in Computer Science studies at 42 Porto, I'm focused on sharpening my skills in C language projects and Shell Scripts. Engaged in regular peer code reviews, I refine my coding and communication abilities while supplementing my learning with Cybersecurity courses to merge theory with practical labs.

⏩ C, Python, SQL, Shell Scripting and Assembly are among the languages and technologies I'm deepening my knowledge in. My passion lies in web technologies, web systems and security.

🧑‍💻 My journey as a future-focused human firewall has its roots in my previous role as an Electrical Engineer. There, I honed skills in organization, discipline, problem-solving and communication under pressure, all of which prepare me well for this digital transformation journey.

👀 What am I good at? My ability to identify the context and circumstances of a problem before taking action helps me make correct assumptions. Active listening, analysis, research and creativity are essential to my problem-solving process. I also value watching other devs solve problems to enrich my learning.

💻 The first apps I wrote were crucial for my evolution in the field, helping me understand non-trivial nuances. I've realized that language and framework foundations are specialized and context-specific, and while I may not become an expert in all languages, having a solid foundation makes adapting to new technologies easier. Every day is an opportunity to learn and grow.

🌞 The most significant recent achievement in my journey was emigrating to Portugal. This decision, made before the COVID-19 pandemic, presented financial challenges, but my strategic approach and resilience have allowed me to adapt successfully to living abroad. Alongside this move, my focus has been on aligning my professional trajectory to thrive in the Portuguese market.

🔌 In all periods, I've had exposure to different software, process automation, and programming languages, requiring adaptability in the face of various realities and adversities. Through experiences, I've learned that I never lose; I either win or learn.

⌚ The career transition from hardware to the software world has been my most significant recent challenge, along with adapting to life in a new country.

❗ The definition of a team, in my opinion, is a group of people who share goals and a common notion of what it means to win. I prefer being a team player over playing alone and believe in building professional relationships of trust.

💞️ Looking to collaborate on tasks that evolve my coding skills, I'm always eager to learn new technologies.

🎓 I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering and an MBA in Energy Business.

📚 Portuguese, Spanish and English speaker and based in Portugal, I'm in the Western European Time zone and reachable anytime.
